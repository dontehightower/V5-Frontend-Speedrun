## Vue Frontend Development Projects

* Use Vue and whatever frameworks or libraries you want
* Don't get sued for copyright - mark clones as clones, attribute resources, etc.
* Feel free to do an "inspired by" rather than a direct clone
* Do projects in order, no skipping around. 
* Mark Complete Date as "Before Speedrun" for any projects you completed before the Speedrun (unless you redo them during the Speedrun).
