# Chart the Stock Market

## Objective

Build a full stack app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

* User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

* User Story: I can remove stocks.

* User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
