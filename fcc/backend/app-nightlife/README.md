# Build a Nightlife Coordination App

## Objective

Build a full stack app that is functionally similar to this: http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/.

## Requirements

* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

**Hint:** Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
