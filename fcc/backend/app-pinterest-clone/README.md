# Build a Pinterest Clone

## Objective

Build a full stack app that is functionally similar to this: https://midnight-dust.hyperdev.space.

## Requirements

* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

* User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

**Hint:** Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
