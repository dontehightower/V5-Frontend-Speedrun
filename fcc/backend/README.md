# Backend Projects

## Notes

* Pick the backend language and ecosystem you prefer - node.js, golang, python, java, rust, elixer, php, ruby - whatever you like - but be consistent and use the same for all the projects, it will make integrating them into the comprehensive portfolio later an easier process.
* Use the frontend framework you intend to use for the data visualization projects if you'd like the additional practice.
* Consider using Sass/Scss, Less or Stylus, whichever you intend to use in the data visualization projects.
* Try to keep to a consistent coding and design style across the projects, it will make integrating them into the comprehensive portfolio later an easier process.
