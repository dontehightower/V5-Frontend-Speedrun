# Frontend Projects

## Notes

* Use the frontend framework you intend to use for the data visualization projects if you'd like the additional practice.
* Consider using Sass/Scss, Less or Stylus, whichever you intend to use in the data visualization projects.
* Try to keep to a consistent coding and design style across the projects, it will make integrating them into the comprehensive portfolio later an easier process.
