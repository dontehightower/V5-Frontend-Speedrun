# Build a JavaScript Calculator

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

* User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

* User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
