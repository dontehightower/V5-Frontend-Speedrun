## Requirements

* User Story: I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.

* User Story: I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json
