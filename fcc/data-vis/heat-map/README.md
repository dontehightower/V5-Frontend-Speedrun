# Visualize Data with a Heat Map

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNLYPp/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.

* User Story: Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.

* User Story: I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json
