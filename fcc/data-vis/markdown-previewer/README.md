# Build a Markdown Previewer

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

* User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

**Hint:** You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
