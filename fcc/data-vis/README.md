# Data Visualization Projects

## Notes

* Use D3 for charting / graphing
* Pick whichever frontend framework you prefer, try to stick to the same framwork across all projects (it'll make aggregating into a portfolio easier) - common choices are Angular 2, React, and Vue
* Try to use a CSS preprocessor where it makes sense to do so - common choices are Sass/Scss, Less, and Stylus
