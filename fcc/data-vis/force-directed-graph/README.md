# Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVopBo.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

* User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json

**Hint:** You can create a spritesheet of national flags at https://www.flag-sprites.com.
