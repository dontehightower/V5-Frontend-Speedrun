## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONxvaa/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can see performance time visualized in a scatterplot graph.

* User Story: I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json
